Since Doze was introduced in Android 6.0, it's been a constant source of pain for developers who can't keep background processes running reliably, and users who are constantly missing important notifications because the system automatically decides to kill background services. Some ROMs are worse than others, with MIUI being the worst offender and AOSP being somewhat tolerable.

DozeOff automatically disables Doze when the system is booted on your rooted device, simple as that. 

In addition to disabling Doze, you can also optionally keep the CPU and WiFi awake at all times, but this will drain the battery very quickly.
